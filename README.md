# hl-preproc
> Unhighlight invalid preprocessor region

This package uses [meta-net](https://github.com/emacs-vs/meta-net) to parse
all define constants inside a csproj file. The output of the highlighting
should be very close to IDE but more lightweight. We only extract information
we need to do the highlighting.

## üíæ Quickstart

```el
(use-package hl-preproc
  :ensure t
  :hook (csharp-mode . (lambda () (hl-preproc-mode 1))))
```

## üî® Basic Usage

##### `(hl-preproc-mode &optional ARG)`

To enable/disable this package.

##### `hl-preproc-extra-constants`

Extra define constants, just in case if [meta-net](https://github.com/emacs-vs/meta-net)
does not parse define constants correctly.

##### `hl-preproc-delay`

Seconds of delay before highlighting invalid preprocessor regions.

##### `hl-preproc-face`

Face to highlight all invalid code.
